## Introduction

Hello, my name is Nkateko Tibane. Just a curious IT student who has passion for low-level development and security (both userspace and kernel). I enjoy breaking down complex systems and documenting my findings. I  am currently building exploit development and reverse engineering tools  to help accelerate my workflow. I'm constantly learning and building, aiming to contribute to real-world vulnerability research and exploit development.

## Projects & Experience

**[TibaneC2](https://github.com/t1b4n3/TibaneC2)** 

A command and control (`C2`) framework built for offensive security, written mostly in C and C++.  It is used to communicate with compromised systems that are infected with implants, which are issued commands  to perform malicious actions.   
*Components*: A server, CLI console, and a implant.

*Highlights*: 
-  Uses a custom encrypted communication channel.
- Database model for operator actions and keeping track of implants.


**[pwntrace](https://github.com/t1b4n3/pwntrace)** (in progress)

A custom tool that attaches or spawns processes and traces and manipulates system calls.
*Highlights*:
- Dynamic Analysis: Observ process behavior in real-time.
- Exploit Development: Stub or trace syscalls to streamline exploit creation.

**[CTF Writeups](https://github.com/t1b4n3/ctf-writeups)** (ongoing)

Solved and documented challenges to practice binary exploitation. 

**[Blog](https://t1b4n3.github.io/)**

I document exploit development & reverse engineering notes, CTF writeups and personal learning projects.
