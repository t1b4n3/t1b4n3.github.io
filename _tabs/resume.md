## Introduction

Hello, my name is Nkateko Tibane. Just a curious IT student who has passion for low-level development and security (both userspace and kernel). I enjoy breaking down complex systems and documenting my findings. I  am currently building exploit development and reverse engineering tools  to help accelerate my workflow. I'm constantly learning and building, aiming to contribute to real-world vulnerability research and exploit development.

## Relevant Experience

**[TibaneC2](https://github.com/t1b4n3/TibaneC2)**  | June 2025 - Present

- Built a full C2 framework with custom encrypted communication protocol, enabling secure bidirectional communication between server, CLI console and implants. 
- Designed and Implemented a C server supporting mulit-implant orchestration and operator command routing.
- Developed a database-backed event model for tracking operator actions, implant tasks, logs, and session metadata.

**[pwntrace](https://github.com/t1b4n3/pwntrace)** | November 2025 - Present

- Developed a ptrace-based tool to spawn or attach to processes and observe system calls.
- Added syscall interception, manipulation and stubbing, enabling easier dynamic analysis for reverse engineers and also enabling exploit developers to test payload behaviour under controlled conditions.

**[CTF Writeups](https://github.com/t1b4n3/ctf-writeups)** |

Categories: pwn, RE

Solved and documented challenges to practice binary exploitation. 

**[Personal Blog](https://t1b4n3.github.io/)** |

- Publish articles on exploit development, reverse engineering and systems internals.
- Document research and learning progress.
