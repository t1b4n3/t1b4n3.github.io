Symbolic execution is a way to analyse a program and determine which inputs cause which specific part of a program to execute. Symbolic execution uses symbolic values instead of regular input values. This allows to construct a result that can be expressed as an equation of these symbolic values, and can be solved mathematically.

Symbolic execution is a powerful tool for code verification, bug hunting and reverse engineering.
