# Type confusion

A type confusion vulnerability can be used to trick an application into handling an object of one type as an object of another type. This vulnerability exists in object oriented programming languages like Java, C#, C++, etc. This type of vulnerability could allow an attacker to access private data of objects that are not supposed to be accessed.

Type confusion vulnerabilities are logic error vulnerabilities and as such there is no easy way to find them.
