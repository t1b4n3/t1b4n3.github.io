# Server Side Request Forgery

Server-Side Request Forgery (`SSRF`), is a  web security vulnerability that allows a attacker to manipulate server functionality, enabling them to access sensitive internal systems or external resources that would otherwise remain out of reach.

This vulnerability exists mostly because the server provides the function of obtaining data from other server applications and does not filter and limit the target address.

The main types of attacks you can achieve using `SSRF`:
1. You can read local files using the `file` protocol.
2. Attack applications running on intranet or local networks.
3. Fingerprint recognition of the intranet web application, by accessing the default file.
4. Attack web applications inside and outside the network, mainly attacks that can be implemented using GET parameters.
5. You can perform port scanning on the external network, the intranet where the server is located, and local internet.


Where can you find `SSRF` vulnerabilities:
Where a possibility to initiate a network request, there may be an SSRF

- Database built-in functions.
- Webmail 
- File processing, encoding processing, and  attribute information processing.
- Requests resources from a remote server.
